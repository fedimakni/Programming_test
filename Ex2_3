Both programs are a simple linear filter that used to reduce the amount of intensity
variation between one pixel and the next. They are often used to reduce noise in images.
They are also very easy to implement.

The program in Question 2-1 is faster than the program in Question 2-2 but it is not
precise as it only takes the four pixels (up, bottom, right, left) and the four corner
pixels are not used in the decision.

The program in Question 2-2 is very precise it uses the nine pixels (including the pixel itself)
in the decision but both of them preserve edges, meaning after applying the filter
the location of edges in your image will move. They donâ€™t preserve details of image.
Some details are removed using these filters.
